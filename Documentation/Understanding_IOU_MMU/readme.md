# Understanding the MMU and IOU

## Note: This part of the documentation is under construction

** FIXME Explanations of what exactly are the schematics
** FIXME Explanations about what was not implemented (VLC HIGH)
** FIXME Links to schematics

## IOU
 - [Power-On event and /RESET Pin](reset-and-power-on.md)
 - [Video Scanner](video-scanner.md)
 - [Address decoding inside the IOU](iou-address-decoder.md)
 - [IOU Timing Signals](iou-soft-switches.md)
 - [The Display Address Generation](display-address.md)
 - [The Keyboard Subsystem](iou_keyboard_subsystem.md)
 - [The Soft Switches of the IOU](iou-soft-switches.md)
 - [Misc circuits](spkr-casso-other.md)

## MMU

** FIXME: also describe the transistor level schematics?
