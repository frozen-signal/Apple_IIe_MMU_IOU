# The Soft Switches of the IOU

## Overview

The IOU is in charge of a few soft switches. Some are exclusive to the IOU, while others are mirrored between the IOU and the MMU. In the IOU, they control several aspects of the display and the annunciators. They can be divided in two groups; those controlled by an address in the C00X range, and those controlled by an address in the C05X range.
