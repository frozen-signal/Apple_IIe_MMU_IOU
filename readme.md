# Apple IIe MMU and IOU custom ICs

This is a VHDL implementation of the Apple IIe's MMU and IOU custom ICs, based on the actual schematics that were used during the development of the Apple IIe.

## Hardware tests
The IOU has been tested with these hardware components:
- Motherboards:
  - Rev.B motherboard.
- CPU:
  - 6502 with unenhanced ROMs
  - 65C02 with enhanced ROMS
  - A recent WDC65C02 with enhanced ROMS
- AUX Cards:
  - RAMWORKS III aux card
  - 80-Col Expansion card (820-0067-B)
  - 80-Col Expansion card (820-0067-D)
- ROMS:
  - Enhanced ROMS from ReActiveMicro
  - Unhanced ROMS (342-0132-B, 342-0133-A, 342-0134-A, 342-0135-A)

The MMU has not been tested.

# Compiling and testing
## Prerequisites
A VHDL compiler such as GHDL is required, and optionnaly a wave analyser such as GTKWave can be used to view the tests outputs.
## Compiling
VHDL files must first be analysed. For example for a file `my_vhdl_component.vhdl` run the command:
```bash
ghdl -a --workdir=work my_vhdl_component.vhdl
```
Then, the component must be elaborated. For example, if the file above contains a component named `MY_VHDL_COMPONENT`, this would elaborate the component:
```bash
ghdl -e --workdir=work MY_VHDL_COMPONENT
```
Finally, to run a testbench once it has been analysed and elaborated, run this command
```bash
ghdl -r --workdir=work MY_COMPONENT_TB  --vcd=debug.vcd
```
This will run the testbench `MY_COMPONENT_TB` and dump the generated signals in the file `debug.vcd`. To view the dump, run:
```bash
gtkwave debug.vcd
```
## Compiling all
Alternatively, all the sources can be analysed and elaborated with this command:
```bash
./make.sh
```
(You can ignore warnings saying "... is neither an entity nor a configuration")

And all testbenches can be simulated with this command:
```bash
./testall.sh
```

# Directory Structure
* **COMMON**: Components common to the MMU and the IOU.
* **CUSTOM**: Components that may need to be changed depending on the hardware used.
* **TTL**: Implementation of a few TTL components used in the schematics.
* **MMU**: Components that makes the MMU.
* **IOU**: Components that makes the IOU.
* **test**: Testing components, testbenches and test-cases; has the same structure as the base directory.

# Notation in the code that references the schematics.
Throughout the code, there are comments that refers to the emulator schematics. The format is `[Schematics] @[Coords]:[Component]-[OutPin]`
For example this:
```
    -- MMU_1 @B-1:L2-8
    CASEN_N <= OCASEN_N and PHI_0;
```
refers to the schematic named `MMU_1.jpg`, at a location near `B-1` and is the output pin `8` of the component `L2`.

# Notes:
## Bonding options
The schematics contains "hard-coded" values and bonding options. These are the values used:
```
64K: HIGH
VLC: LOW (refers to "Very Low Cost"; the codename of the Apple IIc)
INVIO': LOW
DIANA: HIGH ("Diana" was the codename for the Apple IIe)
```
Note that all parts of the schematics associated with unselected values of these bonding options has been left out of of this implementation.

## Hardware implementation
### IOU RESET_N pin
The RESET_N pin (pin 15) of the IOU need to be pulled-up. If the CPLD/FPGA do not support internal pull-up, a 3KOhms resistor should be used.

### Tri-State pins
A hardware solution should take care not to break the tri-state capability of some of the pins of the MMU and IOU, for example by using a bus tranceiver without exporting a corresponding 'enable' signal from the VHDL.
These are the tri-state pins and their corresponing enable signal:

**MMU**:
| Pin(s) | Enable signal |
| --- | --- |
| ORA0-7  | RA_ENABLE_N |
| MD7  | MD7_ENABLE_N |

**IOU**:
| Pin(s) | Enable signal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PIN_RESET_N  | FORCE_RESET_N_LOW | The IOU will force RESET_N low for ~35ms after power-on, then will let external components drive this signal. |
| ORA0-7  | RA_ENABLE_N | Depending on the timings, ORA will be an input, an output pin or tri-state. |
| MD7  | MD7_ENABLE_N | |

## In development
This project is in active development; while all the components are tested, bear in mind that problems might still exist.
To facilitate debugging, the code has been kept very close to the logic seen in the schematics, at the cost of efficiency and readibility. Simplifications of the logic will be done later.
