# Schematics

## Where are the schematics or gerber files for an actual IOU / MMU replacement adapter?

This project is code-only and does not include any hardware designs such as Gerber files or a Bill of Materials (BOM) for building physical adapters.<br/>
The hardware projects are located here:
### 3.3V Adapter reference designs
- [3.3V IOU adapter](https://github.com/frozen-signal/Apple_IIe_IOU_3V3)
- [3.3V MMU adapter](https://github.com/frozen-signal/Apple_IIe_MMU_3V3)
### 5V Adapter reference designs
- 5V IOU adapter (To be done)
- 5V MMU adapter (To be done)


## Origin of these schematics

These schematics were obtained by Henry S. Courbis, founder of ReActiveMicro, at KansasFest 2016. They seem to be the logic schematics for an emulator that combines both the IOU and the MMU. The exact purpose of this emulator is unknown, but they seem to cover everything the IOU and MMU does. It's possible that it was used to develop what would become the Apple //c. The transistor level schematic seem to be closer to the actual MMU, but it is unknown exactly how similar it is to the official MMU.

These schematics has been edited to reduce their size.<br/><br/>
