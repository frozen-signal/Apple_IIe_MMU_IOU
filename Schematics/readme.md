# Schematics

## Where are the schematics or gerber files for an actual IOU / MMU replacement adapter?

This project is code-only and does not include any hardware designs such as Gerber files or a Bill of Materials (BOM) for building physical adapters. If you're looking to integrate this into an Apple IIe, you'll need to design your own hardware or find third-party solutions that suit your needs.
<br/>
On the other hand, [ReActiveMicro](https://www.reactivemicro.com/) is currently designing and manufacturing a replacement adapter based on this project, and should be available relatively soon.
