This This directory contains few implementations of DELAY_OSCILLATOR. This component generate a clock signal that is used to generate the delays.

#### NOP
This implementation do not generate a clock signal.
To be used when the delays are not generated from an internal oscillator and with the testbenches.

#### VENDOR/LATTICE/MACHXO3D
This can be used with the Lattice's MACHXO3D FPGA.
